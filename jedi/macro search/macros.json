Read over our short guide to learn how this works:\n  \nhttp://kb.weebly.com/email-forward.html\n  \nEmail Forwarding enables you to forward any email sent to your domain name over to your personal email address (or addresses) at a provider like Gmail or Yahoo. This lets you manage your new email addresses without the need for a second or third inbox to constantly check in addition to your personal email. \n  \nBut this isn't the only option. \n  \nIf you don't want forwarding and instead prefer an actual email inbox for your domain name, you're also welcome to set up email with Google Apps mail. This provides a complete email solution through the Gmail interface. It's more complicated to set up, but works like a charm, and is always an option if you don't want to go the email forward route. Take a look at our tutorial: \n  \nhttp://kb.weebly.com/setup-email.html\n  \nThe only drawback here is cost: Google has just recently started charging $50 a year for this service.  "

It is also a common sign-up method used across many different sites on the internet.\n\nFor this to cause a problem, someone would have to sit between your internet connection and Weebly. The only way they could do that is through an unsecured wireless network. So someone would have to knowingly target you through your unsecured wireless network (within range of that network) and be looking to sniff for this information. Then figure out what it is and find some value to taking over a Weebly account through which they could gain no personal information about you (we don't display payment info or anything else in a publicly accessible way in the account) or do much of anything aside from vandalize the site.\n\nSo while I agree that this is a security hole and fully appreciate your concerns, it is one that has little to no chance of actually causing a problem. We do intend to provide an HTTPS login at some point in the future, but this is not as easy as just flipping a switch and making it happen.\n\nIf there's anything further I can assist you with, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you.

The following page in our support center provides specific steps and information detailing how to get initially indexed and better ranked in search engines, however, this is the only information regarding SEO our support center will be able to provide.\n\n[The Basics of SEO](http://kb.weebly.com/seo.html)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J8ZdPGxUIU&list=UUF8HNx9282f1dPrXsgrxtnw\n\nIt isn't necessary to list your site with Webmaster Tools to get indexed by Google, but it can be very helpful for improving your ranking.  The following article on our help site shows the exact steps you should take in order to get verified with Google Webmaster tools. Our short guide walks through this process if you'd like to give it a go:  \n\nhttps://weebly.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201723433-Verify-Your-Site-with-Search-Engines\n\n[Getting Verified by Google](http://kb.weebly.com/webmaster-tools.html)\n\nYou can also be verified by Bing if you'd like to take those extra steps:\n\n[Getting Verified by Bing](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)\n\nYou can do some optimization to help ensure your images show up in a Google image search, but it's not as fine-tuned as it is for a regular page search since there's less information for the search engines to work with.\n\nHere are some things you can do:\n\n* Use a descriptive image alt tag\n* Embed your images in relevant pages\n* Use a relevant heading and/or caption next to the image\n* Include relevant descriptive links near the image\n* Use descriptive anchor text to link to the image from other pages\n\nIf search results don't show recent changes you've made to the Title and Description area of your site, keep in mind that this is because search engines are not updated in real-time. It can take anywhere from a couple of days to a few weeks for a change made a page on your site to be reflected in the small preview area shown by a search engine. And there's no way for us as a company or for you individually to speed up this process, though Google is usually speedier about indexing your site if you set up a free Webmaster account with them.\n\nAnd note that if a visitor clicks on the link to your site provided by the search engine they'll see the newest version of your site. There is no delay with that at all. It's only the preview area shown in the search engine results that takes time to update.\n\nWhile we don't offer specific advice or assistance for this, here are some suggestions to  help you grow your website traffic:\n\n**Spread the Word** - Tell your customers, family & friends about your site.\n\n**[Optimize for Search Engines](http://kb.weebly.com/seo.html)** - make sure people can find you on Google.\n\n**Update Regularly** - keeping your website content fresh gives visitors a reason to come back.\n\n**Use Your Social Network** - post your site to Facebook, Twitter and/or LinkedIn whenever you update your content.\n\n**[Start a Blog](http://kb.weebly.com/new-blog.html)** - a blog is an easy way to regularly add new content to your site and attract and build repeat visits.\n\n**[Add a Facebook Like Button](http://kb.weebly.com/facebook-like.html)** - so your visitors can easily share your website with their friends.\n\n**Promote Your Site** - add a link to your email signature, include a link to your site when you post to forums or comment on articles.\n\n**[Start an Email Newsletter](http://kb.weebly.com/newsletter-form.html)** - use it as a tool to bring visitors back to your website.\n\n**Get Reciprocal Links** - swap links with other websites that have a similar audience to drive free qualified traffic.\n\n**Try Pay-Per-Click Advertising** - drive targeted traffic to your website.\n\nIf you need an SEO consultant, there are a number of third-party companies out there that are happy to assist Weebly users. If you search Google for \"SEO consultant\" you'll see many of them on the first page. While we don't currently endorse any companies or consultants in particular, I'm confident you will be able to find a consultant to help with your individual needs."]

An email alias enables you to receive mail from a different address through the same inbox. Let’s say you create a Google Apps email like this one:\n\nme@tomtravels.net\n\nYou can also have aliases of this address like tom@tomtravels.net, contact@tomtravels.net, thisisanemailaddress@tomtravels.net, and upto27otherthings@tomtravels.net.\n\nHow is an alias different from a normal email address? It differs in that all the messages sent to an alias are simply forwarded to another address. In the example above, mail sent to tom@tomtravels.net and contact@tomtravels.net would be forwarded to the inbox for me@tomtravels.net. This makes aliases useful for a single person who wants multiple addresses, but not useful for creating addresses for different people since it’s very unlikely you’d want different people all using the same email inbox.\n\nYou can learn all about how to set this up using our short guide here: \n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201789187-Create-Aliases-of-an-Email-Address"]

We have to pay the higher rate to renew the domain because it's gone into a state known as the \"Redemption Grace Period\" due to how long it's been expired.  \n\nIf you are interested in renewing this domain immediately, please submit your payment through http://charge.weebly.com/expired-domain.html and reply back to let us know once complete.  We will then pay to reactivate your domain and everything will be back up and running.\n\nYou should purchase the domain from RGP now if you want to bring it back online immediately; otherwise, you can wait and attempt to register it once it's fully available again (which occurs roughly 75 days after the original expiration date), but note that it will then be available to register by anyone, and you could potentially lose ownership of it.\n\nYour domain will be removed from RGP in a few days based on what we see in our system. So if you want to wait it out and register it again as new, you certainly can. Just note again that anyone else will be able to register it after the RGP period ends so you'll want to act fast simply to make sure you don't lose your domain to someone else."]

According to the rules of ICANN (the international organization that oversees all domain registrations in the world), a domain cannot be transferred while it's expired and there is generally about a 3 month period after the domain expires before it is released to be re-registered."]

We don't currently offer this as an integrated feature as it would have a very dramatic (and negative) impact on how the site functions. \n\nBeyond that, it is generally a bad idea to have music auto-play continuously throughout an entire website. Why? Because many of your site's visitors will be listening to music of their own, watching TV or movies in the background, or listening to other audio of some kind. Having music play on your site automatically will be a major annoyance for those visitors and more likely than not lead to them immediately leaving your site.

But other than the major visual changes, the editor continues to work in the exact same way:  \n\n1. You still drag elements to the page to add content. The elements function in the same way they always have (except that a few of them now have some added features): you now drag them from the left instead of from the top. \n\n2.

Our new formatting removes all that excess, providing cleaner blog post URLs that look much more like the URLs we use for our standard pages. Here's the same post shown above in the new style:\n\nhttp://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something\n\nYour own blog post links have been cleaned up in this same way.\n\nDoes this mean the old links will no longer work? Not at all. All of your older post links automatically redirect to the new version of that same post. To see this in action, click on the http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html link. Notice how it leads directly to the http://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something page? \nAny old links from your blog will forward to the new URLs in the same way.\n\nHope this info helps!\n\n"]

These slideshows function in much the same way as our standard slideshows, excepting, of course, that they've been designed to work specifically with the Header of the site.  \n\nPlease note that some of our themes use background images for the header / banner area of of the site instead of using the standard headers that most of our other themes use. This makes it impossible to use the Header Slideshow option. You can tell if you're currently using one of these themes by clicking to edit the header image. If it shows you an option to select or upload a background image, then you will not be able to use a slideshow in the header area.\n\nThe only real option to use Header Slideshows is to switch to a theme that supports this feature. Many of our themes **do** support this feature, so it's fairly easy to find one. What you will look for is a Theme that has a \"contained\" header area, rather than a screen-wide one.\n\nYou can learn how to switch themes here:\n\nhttps://weebly.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201696407-How-to-Switch-Themes"]

At first glance, that may make it appear that Weebly no longer works in a way that you expect it to work. I’m truly sorry for that. \n\nBut I also promise that the changes we’ve made here dramatically improve the way our columns (and our entire editor) works. We have a short video that details all of the changes and I think it’s worth a look: \n\nhttps://weebly.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202497066\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the changes we’ve made (which is also covered in the video and at the above page): \n \nUpdate #1: Columns are created automatically\nWhereas before you needed to use the old Columns element to place one element next to another, you can now simply drag elements next to each other right on the page. Doing so creates two or three or four or however many columns you need. These then function just like the Columns element previously did. \n\nUpdate #2: Column widths snap to a grid\nAs before, you can adjust the width of a column simply by dragging the blue line that divides two columns. To help keep column widths consistent between pages we've introduced a grid system to which all columns snap. If you want to break free of this grid, just hold \"Shift\" while you drag the column divider line and you can drag it wherever you like. \n\nUpdate #3: New Behavior for Moving and Copying Columns\nIt may appear that the options to \"Move\" and \"Copy\" a set of columns has been removed. But this isn't the case at all. You simply have to click on one of the divider lines in that set of columns and the move / copy controls will appear in the upper left of the columns as always.\n\nUpdate #4: New Text+Image Behavior\nWe've removed the Text+Image element because you can now drag an image right on to (or out of) a block of text. This makes it much simpler to add an image to a page and allow text to wrap around it. \n\nUpdate #5: New Spacer Element\nWe've added a new Spacer Element so you add extra space to a page as needed. This element can be made as wide or as tall as needed to ensure it best fits your design. \n\nIf what I’ve described here does not fit with what you’re seeing, can you give me a little more detail so I can look into this issue and get it fixed for you? I promise we’ll make sure things work better for you than ever before. "]

It may work for you for a month and then break your formatting without warning. \n\nTo fix any of these formatting issues just select / highlight any text that has a different font and click the Tx button in the text toolbar. This will strip the extra formatting and cause the text to snap to whatever font you have selected for your site under Design > Design Options.\n\nThe best approach to avoid these issues altogether is to copy and paste your text from Word into a plain text document, and then adjust the formatting within Weebly.  You can create plain text documents via the NotePad program on PC or the TextEdit program on Mac. \n\nThough Word (and similar programs) use formatting that can destroy the font formatting of a webpage, pasting from Plain Text works perfectly.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you."]

Then next time you publish, it will show up underneath that page in your navigation.\n\nFor more help creating subpages, please see \n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201505656-Create-Pages-and-Navigation\n\nPlease keep in mind that it isn't possible to make a top-level navigation page link unclickable so that only the sub-pages can be clicked.  The best work-around for this is to add links directly to the main page that lead to each of the sub-pages.  That way, people who click the main page link don't see a blank page.    \n\nFor assistance creating links, please see:\n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201018148-Create-Links"]

You may want to use a third-party document viewer to embed your documents (like CrocoDoc.com). You'd upload the document to their service and then add it to your site via our Embed Code element.

We added it to our editor in partnership with Tal.ki in order to provide our users an easy way to simply drag a forum on to their site.  \n\nThere are two options going forward:\n\n1 -- Stick with the forum you have.  It should be available and working again shortly.  \n\n2 -- Start a new forum via a tool like nabble.com.  It's easy to add a Nabble forum to your site and Nabble has been around for a long time.  Pretty confident they're not going anywhere. \n\nWhen you build a forum with a tool like Nabble.com they give you embed code to use to add the forum to your site.  All you'd need to do to place it on your Weebly site is copy & paste that code into one of our Embed Code Elements.

Malware on your computer or in your browser. If you check your site from another computer, you won't see any ads because they're not actually part of your webpage. You should run a full virus scan on your computer and if the problem persists, try something like Adaware (http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php) which searches for and disables adware in particular. Or try this very easy guide to removing it:\n\nhttp://botcrawl.com/how-to-remove-text-enhance/\n\nOR\n\n2). Third party code on your site that is overtaking your content to serve ads.  This is most commonly caused by a click counter.  If you have a click counter at the bottom of your site somewhere, I'd recommend removing it. \n\nI cannot stress enough that Weebly does not and will not run ads on your website.  We are a profitable company and the reason we're profitable is because many of our users upgrade to our Pro / Domain services.

Each teacher can manage up to 40 students from one account and each student can build their own site with up to five pages.  The teacher can build up to ten of his / her own sites with unlimited pages. \n\nFor other schools, the Pro version of Weebly for Education is a better fit.  This allows students to build up to five sites each with unlimited pages and provides access to a number of other features that are detailed here:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/faq-proed.html\n\nThe Pro version is $39.95 per teacher account, per year. \n\nBoth free and Pro Weebly for Education accounts allow you to administer up to 40 student accounts, but if you need more students, you can purchase extra accounts for $10 per 10 extra students.  See how that works here:\n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/210898937-Add-and-Manage-Students\n\nFor schools that want Pro service for fifteen teachers or more, the Campus edition is an even better fit as it provides Pro service at a discount and allows a school administrator to manage teachers from a central campus account.

Only you can decide which option is right for you.\n\nYou can create a separate Weebly account for each client. I would suggest that you create these accounts yourself initially. Once you've received payment for your services and you're ready to turn the site over to the client, you can change the e-mail and password to make them the account owner. They can always invite you as an administrator so that you have continuing access to the account.\n\nThe advantage to doing it this way is that each site is separate and independent. If you decide you no longer wish to maintain any of your sites (or a particular client's site), it's easy for that client to go off on their own. The client has a little added security and peace of mind in knowing that they are the account owner and site owner (once you've turned it over to them, of course). The drawback is that your clients still know that you're using Weebly.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe other option would be [Weebly for Designers] (http://designers.weebly.com). This is a completely white-labeled version of our software which allows you to offer an end-to-end design and hosting solution under your own brand. Your clients will never see the Weebly name or know that they're using Weebly at all. The only thing they'll see is your name. You'll create your own portal page where the clients can log in to manage their sites and they have exactly the permissions you grant them. You have a great deal of control over what clients can or can't do on their own sites. You manage all the client sites from a single dashboard but each client logs in through their own account and can only see their site.\n\nClient sites include the Pro features by default so they don't have to be upgraded to Pro separately but they are charged a monthly hosting fee for each site ($7.95 a month). You're only billed for sites that are published live, so you can take as long as you need to build the site and you only pay once the work is completed, the client has approved the site, and it goes live. All Pro features are included with any sites built in a Designer account. \n\nHopefully this info helps!"]

We provide free hosting for all our users (along with unlimited bandwidth and file storage, a free website builder, etc.), therefore we must charge full price for domain registration.\n\nWhile you can register your domain name with GoDaddy for about $10 per year, by the time you add in all the services that Weebly provides for free, the price is significantly higher.\n\nIf you have a Weebly Starter or Pro subscription, you can register your domain with a discount registrar and host the site with Weebly. In the long run, this can cause a lot of headaches since you'll be responsible for updating your own DNS settings to point to Weebly and you'll need to manage accounts with two different companies. There is a lot to be said for the simplicity of having your registration and hosting with one company and having all the setup and configuration done for you.\n\nUltimately, we'll be happy to help you with whatever option you choose. If you are looking at discount registrars, please look for one that gives you full control over your DNS settings (in particular you'll need the ability to create A-records and if you plan to have e-mail you'll need access to MX records). Many discount registrars only allow you to change nameservers unless you purchase a hosting package in addition to your domain registration. Some other \"catches\" you should look out for include a deep discount on your first year of registration and a higher price for renewal, a discounted price for registration only if you purchase hosting from the company, and you need to make sure that the domain will be registered in your name and can be transferred to another registrar at a later date."]

This allows you to invite your clients to assist in maintaining and editing their sites without their knowing that Weebly is in any way involved with the creation or hosting of that site. \n\nMost Partner / White Label platforms charge a hefty upfront fee to even use their system.  We don't do anything of the sort.  Our pricing is based entirely on a monthly rate per site, so you're only paying for the sites you create.   So you only pay us if you're successfully making money from the platform. \n\nIf you have no need for a White Label system, then you are welcome to design websites for your clients using regular Weebly (weebly.com) with Weebly Pro.  This is less expensive, but if you invite your clients to help edit their own sites they'll be able to see that you're using our service."]

That is how it is supposed to work, and it makes sense. Unfortunately, Facebook is a little quirky about which images it will recognize and which ones it won't, so it can be hit or miss.  This isn't a problem only with Weebly; it can occur when posting a link from any website, and there is not a whole lot that you or I can do about it right now.\nSometimes if you go to post the link and don't see all of the images in your post, you can cancel and then try adding the link again.  I have found that the images often will show up the second time even if they didn't on the first try.\n"]

So it's officially and fully registered for the entire period for which you paid us. So if you were hoping to cancel this domain to purchase it elsewhere, that's not technically possible. This isn't because of a policy on Weebly's side, but because of a policy of ICANN; the international non-profit organization that oversees the registration of all domain names in the world.  \n\nNow, this does not mean we won't refund your money. You didn't know about the ICANN policy before making your purchase, so we want to honor our 30 day refund policy. What it means instead, is this:\n\n(1) If you don't actually want this domain name and don't mind losing access to it for the length of the registration period, then we'll refund your money in full as soon as you let us know you'd like us to proceed. \n\n(2) If you're hoping to use this domain elsewhere, we can help you move or point the domain to the other host so you can start using it immediately. Since ICANN won't allow us to cancel the domain at this point, this is the only way to use the domain with another host. However, you won't have to pay this new host for the registration or hosting of the domain name since you already paid us for it. \n\nLet us know if you simply want to proceed with the refund or if you need to use the domain elsewhere.

We don't provide support or troubleshooting for the coding itself (check out [Rich Snippets](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/rich-snippets/)), but we can definitely help you get set up on the Weebly side of things!\n\nFor the pages where you want to have rich snippets, you'll go to the Pages tab, Advanced Settings, and insert the rich snippet code in the Header Code field. You could use an Embed Code element but since this code is invisible, it's easy to \"lose\" that Embed Code element on the page. Don't worry if you've already got something in the Header Code field. This code can go either before or after that - just leave a blank line or two between them to help keep things tidy.\n\nThe only time this won't work is on Product pages and blog posts. Since you don't have access to the Header Code for individual blog posts and product pages, you'll need to use an Embed Code element in the blog post or the long description for the Product and you'll just need to remember it's there.\n\nYou won't actually see anything at all on your page when you add the rich snippets, but you can use [Google's Testing Tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/) to make sure Google sees it."]

You can verify this by checking your site address using Google's verification tool: \n\nhttps://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/\n\nThe great majority of Weebly sites are mobile friendly and ready for these changes. So why isn't yours? \n\nThe reason is that you're using one of our older themes and you have the mobile version of that theme turned off. This wasn't previously an issue, but now that Google is changing the way they classify sites in mobile searches it's become more important to have this turned on. \n\nIf you're happy to turn it back on, go to the Settings in the editor and check the box to activate your site's mobile version. Then Publish your site and the problem is solved (though Google's search algorithm may not notice the update for a week or so). \n\nWhat if you don't want to turn it back on because you don't like the mobile version of your site? Then the best best is to switch to one of our Responsive themes. All of our newer themes (those released since early 2014) are what are known as Responsive themes. This means that the theme itself is designed to automatically adapt to the size of the screen and device it's being viewed on. Responsive themes like these are exactly what Google wants to see from a mobile site.\n\nYou can switch to a Responsive theme by going to the Change Themes section found under the Design tab. From there you can sort themes by Newest. The most recent 20 or so themes are all Responsive. Choosing one of these and Publishing your site will also resolve the issue. \n\nWhat if you'd prefer not to do either? \n\nThen Google will not consider your site to be mobile friendly. But this is not necessarily that terrible of a thing. Google considers dozens upon dozens of variables when considering how to rank your site in a given search. Whether or not your site is \"mobile friendly\" is just one of those variables. There's a perfectly good chance your ranking won't change at all if you leave things as they are. \n\nIf you'd like to learn a bit more about what Google is doing with this change, take a look at this short article from our Help Center: \n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/205568447"]

Access the Protection panel.\n3. Click the Web Protection module.\n4. In the Settings tab, click the Whitelist link. A new window will appear.\n5. Provide the address of the blocked website or online application in the corresponding field and click Add.\n6. Click Save to save the changes and close the window.\n\n\nWe've contacted their support to see what we can do to fix the problem but it'd be helpful if you could also complain to them that they're inadvertently blocking your site. They're much more likely to take action if you complain to them as a customer than if we alone complain to them. You can also submit a whitelist request here:\n\nhttp://www.bitdefender.com/submit/\n\nI promise this problem is not on our end and we're doing what we can to get BitDefender to fix the problem.

We removed the ability for users to change their address on the Paypal side of things, but to do this does require that the address provided to Paypal be valid.\n\nAny valid city, state and zip code combinations will not have any problem making it to the payment screen on PayPal.\n\nIf the city, state and zip code combinations don't match, then it will not be possible to get to the payment screen with Paypal. For example if a customer lives in North Las Vegas and they put in Las Vegas as their city, it will not proceed to the Paypal payment page. They would have to specifically put in North Las Vegas.\n\nThis new setting ensures the integrity of the tax and shipping settings that is set in your editor. We will not be reverting this change.

Some of our themes use background images for the header / banner area of of the site instead of using the standard headers that most of our other themes use. You're currently using one of the themes that works in the way I've described. These background images are stripped from the mobile view of your site.\n\nWe understand that it was unclear that the background images on some of these older themes don't show on mobile, and this is why we've either updated most of them them to be responsive themes (where the image does show up) or have dropped them from our list of available themes.\n\nWhile we did drop some themes from the list of available themes, we didn't automatically switch anyone off of the theme they are using (for obvious reasons). This is why, even though we no longer \"offer\" the theme you're using, you have still been able to use it.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to check out some of our newest themes by going to:\n\nDESIGN --> Change Theme --> Sort By --> Newest.\n\nOur newest themes are responsive, the current trend in website building. This means that your site will scale according to the size of screen you are viewing it from. As more users make the switch from Desktop and Laptop computers to tablets and phones for their internet browsing, responsive themes will ensure compatibility on any size screen.\n\nUsing one of these themes will also allow for your background images to show on the mobile view, unlike what you're experiencing with your current theme.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"]

See an example from our own blog:\n\nhttp://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html\n\nNotice the \"2\" and the \"2014\" and the \"04\" in there. It's messy. Our new formatting removes all that stuff, providing cleaner blog post URLs that look much more like the URLs we use for our standard pages. Here's the same post shown above in the new style:\n\nhttp://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something\n\nYour own blog post links have been cleaned up in this same way.\n\nDoes this mean the old links will no longer work? Not at all. All of your older post links automatically redirect to the new version of that same post. To see this in action, click on the http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html link. Notice how it leads directly to the http://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something page? \n\nThe only issue with this is that your Facebook likes for old links aren't going to display on your older posts. Why is that? Because FB ties these Likes directly to the URL of the post itself. So they don't see a Like for http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html as a like for http://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something.\n\nBut that doesn't meant the Likes have gone away. If someone Liked one of your posts in the past, then that Like still shows up on that person's FB wall and if one of their friends clicks on that Like they'll still be lead directly to your post without the slightest issue. FB just isn't smart enough to display the likes associated with the old URLs on the new URLs. \n\nAll new Likes will show up on your blog and on your posts. It's just the older ones that aren't showing and we quite simply have no way to force them to show. I promise, though, that the full value of someone liking your post is still there since the point of someone liking it is to share it with their friends and all those old likes are still shared and still working directly within Facebook. \n\nHope this info helps! \n\n"]

It'll take a few business days before this refund shows up on your credit card or bank statement. \n\nKeep in mind this domain is still registered and will remain so for the entire period you initially selected as we have no way to cancel the domain at this point.
