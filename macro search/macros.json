Read over our short guide to learn how this works:\n  \nhttp://kb.weebly.com/email-forward.html\n  \nEmail Forwarding enables you to forward any email sent to your domain name over to your personal email address (or addresses) at a provider like Gmail or Yahoo. This lets you manage your new email addresses without the need for a second or third inbox to constantly check in addition to your personal email. \n  \nBut this isn't the only option. \n  \nIf you don't want forwarding and instead prefer an actual email inbox for your domain name, you're also welcome to set up email with Google Apps mail. This provides a complete email solution through the Gmail interface. It's more complicated to set up, but works like a charm, and is always an option if you don't want to go the email forward route. Take a look at our tutorial: \n  \nhttp://kb.weebly.com/setup-email.html\n  \nThe only drawback here is cost: Google has just recently started charging $50 a year for this service.  "

It is also a common sign-up method used across many different sites on the internet.\n\nFor this to cause a problem, someone would have to sit between your internet connection and Weebly. The only way they could do that is through an unsecured wireless network. So someone would have to knowingly target you through your unsecured wireless network (within range of that network) and be looking to sniff for this information. Then figure out what it is and find some value to taking over a Weebly account through which they could gain no personal information about you (we don't display payment info or anything else in a publicly accessible way in the account) or do much of anything aside from vandalize the site.\n\nSo while I agree that this is a security hole and fully appreciate your concerns, it is one that has little to no chance of actually causing a problem. We do intend to provide an HTTPS login at some point in the future, but this is not as easy as just flipping a switch and making it happen.\n\nIf there's anything further I can assist you with, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you.

This feature enables your customers to make a purchase through PayPal using any major credit card without the need for a PayPal Account. PayPal only provides this option if you have either a Premiere or Business account with them. \n\nHere's how to turn this on within PayPal:\n\n::Log in to your account at PayPal.com\n\n::Go to your Profile and select \"More Options\"\n\n::Choose \"My Selling Tools\" from the menu on the left. \n\n::Here's you'll find a section called \"Selling Online\". Select Website Preference from this section and click the Update link. \n\n:: Last step! Turn on the \"PayPal Account Optional\" selection and then SAVE your changes at the bottom of the page. \n\nThat'll do the trick! There's nothing extra you need to do with your Weebly site to get this working. As soon as you make the change in PayPal your customers will have the option to either pay with their credit card or log in to their PayPal account (though it may occasionally take PayPal a couple of hours to reflect the change has been made).

Our developers worked with PayPal and found a way around the problem, but it is something you'll need to do in your own account.\n\nThese are the steps to perform:\n\n1. Log into your PayPal account, and then go to My Selling Tools under the Profile menu (it's on the far right of the menu).\n\n2. From the My Selling Tools page, please scroll down to Instant Payment Notifications, and click update.\n\n3. From that page, click the Choose IPN Settings button.\n\n4. You should now be on the page where you can enter a URL into a text field. Please enter any URL there - you can use http://www.google.com/ for example - and then enable IPN, and then save.\n\n5. Please now turn IPN off from the page you're at after saving in the last step. This should force your PayPal account to work properly.\n\nOnce you've performed these steps, you should no longer have a problem.\n\nPlease give that a try and let me know."

The Cart menu should now be gone. \n\nBut I'd recommend not turning it off. Why? \n\nBecause there are an incredible number of new features that come along with this Store tab, one of which is a Mini Cart that helps your customers keep track of everything they're buying from you (and essentially prompts them to purchase as they add more stuff to their cart).

Once you do that, try to log in and you'll get through without an issue. You can always re-enable the browser to block cookies from third parties again once you've logged in, but if you log out and have to re-enter your password then you'll have to \nunblock the cookies again.\n\nShould that not work, unfortunately, the client will need to use a different browser."

An email alias enables you to receive mail from a different address through the same inbox. Let\u2019s say you create a Google Apps email like this one:\n\nme@tomtravels.net\n\nYou can also have aliases of this address like tom@tomtravels.net, contact@tomtravels.net, thisisanemailaddress@tomtravels.net, and upto27otherthings@tomtravels.net.\n\nHow is an alias different from a normal email address? It differs in that all the messages sent to an alias are simply forwarded to another address. In the example above, mail sent to tom@tomtravels.net and contact@tomtravels.net would be forwarded to the inbox for me@tomtravels.net. This makes aliases useful for a single person who wants multiple addresses, but not useful for creating addresses for different people since it\u2019s very unlikely you\u2019d want different people all using the same email inbox.\n\nYou can learn all about how to set this up using our short guide here: \n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201789187-Create-Aliases-of-an-Email-Address"

After the 44 day mark we actually lose direct control over the domain and we have to pay a very hefty fee to bring it back online. \nOur domain registrar has informed us that it would be possible to renew your domain for $80. Please note again that this higher price is not due to fees being assessed by Weebly. We have to pay the higher rate to renew the domain because it's gone into a state known as the \"Redemption Grace Period\" due to how long it's been expired.  \nIf you are interested in renewing this domain immediately, please submit your payment through http://charge.weebly.com/expired-domain.html and reply back to let us know once complete.  We will then pay to reactivate your domain and everything will be back up and running.\nYou should purchase the domain from RGP now if you want to bring it back online immediately; otherwise, you can wait and attempt to register it once it's fully available again (which occurs roughly 75 days after the original expiration date), but note that it will then be available to register by anyone, and you could potentially lose ownership of it.\nYour domain will be removed from RGP in a few days based on what we see in our system. So if you want to wait it out and register it again as new, you certainly can. Just note again that anyone else will be able to register it after the RGP period ends so you'll want to act fast simply to make sure you don't lose your domain to someone else."

After the 34 day mark we actually lose direct control over the domain and we have to pay a very hefty fee to bring it back online. \nOur domain registrar has informed us that it would be possible to renew your domain for $80. Please note again that this higher price is not due to fees being assessed by Weebly. We have to pay the higher rate to renew the domain because it's gone into a state known as the \"Redemption Grace Period\" due to how long it's been expired.  \nIf you are interested in renewing this domain immediately, please submit your payment through http://charge.weebly.com/expired-domain.html and reply back to let us know once complete. If possible, please include the transaction ID of your payment.  We will then pay to reactivate your domain and everything will be back up and running.\nYou should purchase the domain from RGP now if you want to bring it back online immediately; otherwise, you can wait and attempt to register it once it's fully available again (which occurs roughly 75 days after the original expiration date), but note that it will then be available to register by anyone, and you could potentially lose ownership of it.\nYou would have received multiple emails beginning several months ago warning that your domain account had invalid credit card details on file and an update was required in order to renew the domain. Warnings were also at the top of your account stating the same. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience and frustration, but hope that we can fix the situation quickly."

According to the rules of ICANN, the international organization that oversees all domain registrations on the internet, any time a domain is registered anywhere in the world, the owner's information must be submitted to the WHOIS database. This database is searchable on the internet.\nThere are companies who provide WHOIS \"privacy protection\" for a fee. Basically, the company submits their information to the WHOIS database in place of yours. They filter out any junk contacts and forward legitimate contacts to you privately.\nIt's possible to purchase WHOIS Privacy Protection for your domain name. This is $10 per year and you can read more about this (and how to activate it) in our short guide here:\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/whois-privacy.html\nAs an alternative, you can log into your domain control panel and update the administrative contact for your domain, but you can't actually remove the contact information altogether.\nTo manage your domain settings and WHOIS information, log into your Weebly user account first and then go to the 'Domains' tab. Find the domain whose information you'd like to change and click the 'Manage' button. Your WHOIS contact information is accessible and editable there. \nLearn more here:\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/update-whois.html"

Basically, we're not going to pay for the renewal until you confirm that you want to keep the domain by renewing with us. Your website is still online, you still have access to your account, there's nothing to panic about. I can assure you we're not trying to be sneaky or tricky or anything like that. That's just the notation in our billing system which indicates that we've suspended the auto-renewal on the back end.\n\nPlease keep in mind that if you're planning to transfer your domain to a new registrar, that transfer must be completed BEFORE the domain expires. According to the rules of ICANN (the international organization that oversees all domain registrations in the world), a domain cannot be transferred while it's expired and there is generally about a 3 month period after the domain expires before it is released to be re-registered."

We don't currently offer this as an integrated feature as it would have a very dramatic (and negative) impact on how the site functions. \nBeyond that, it is generally a bad idea to have music auto-play continuously throughout an entire website. Why? Because many of your site's visitors will be listening to music of their own, watching TV or movies in the background, or listening to other audio of some kind. Having music play on your site automatically will be a major annoyance for those visitors and more likely than not lead to them immediately leaving your site.

Though we support almost all video formats, if yours isn't working, it's worth exporting your file to MP4, M4V, MOV, WMV or OGG via whatever video editing program you happen to use. Any of these file types should always work. \nIt's also possible that switching to another browser and re-uploading the video from there could fix the issue.  If the first two suggestions don't seem to be causing the issues, please give that a try.\nTake a look at our troubleshooting guide to video upload problems here:\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/video-troubleshoot.html\nIf you still run into any issues after trying these troubleshooting steps, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you."

See an example from our own blog:\nhttp://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html\nNotice the \"2\" and the \"2014\" and the \"04\" in there. It's messy. Our new formatting removes all that excess, providing cleaner blog post URLs that look much more like the URLs we use for our standard pages. Here's the same post shown above in the new style:\nhttp://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something\nYour own blog post links have been cleaned up in this same way.\nDoes this mean the old links will no longer work? Not at all. All of your older post links automatically redirect to the new version of that same post. To see this in action, click on the http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2014/04/start-your-something.html link. Notice how it leads directly to the http://blog.weebly.com/post/start-your-something page? \nAny old links from your blog will forward to the new URLs in the same way.\nHope this info helps!\n"

Change the Text in the button to read: **Button Text** then also remove the button link, and republish your site. This should hide the button on the live site.\n\nOR\n\n2. Switch to another type of Page Layout via the Pages tab or the gear icon next to the header image.

Our new site creator is here to stay. \n\nWe understand that no matter how many improvements we've made, such a big visual change to our service can be incredibly jarring. Especially if you were just hoping to pop in and make a few changes to your site without having to think too much about it. But other than the major visual changes, the editor continues to work in the exact same way:  \n\n1. You still drag elements to the page to add content. The elements function in the same way they always have (except that a few of them now have some added features): you now drag them from the left instead of from the top. \n\n2. Some of the elements have new titles, but those titles still describe the same function. For example: \"Paragraph\" is now called \"Text\"; \"Custom HTML\" is now called \"Embed Code\". \n\nWe have written a short guide to the new site creator that you can read here:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/site-creator.html\n\nYou may also find our Beginner's Guide to Weebly helpful in navigating the new editor: \n\nhttp://help.weebly.com/beginners-guide.html\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the new Editor, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you."

At first glance, that may make it appear that Weebly no longer works in a way that you expect it to work. I\u2019m truly sorry for that. \n\nBut I also promise that the changes we\u2019ve made here dramatically improve the way our columns (and our entire editor) works. We have a short video that details all of the changes and I think it\u2019s worth a look: \n\nhttps://weebly.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202497066\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the changes we\u2019ve made (which is also covered in the video and at the above page): \n \nUpdate #1: Columns are created automatically\nWhereas before you needed to use the old Columns element to place one element next to another, you can now simply drag elements next to each other right on the page. Doing so creates two or three or four or however many columns you need. These then function just like the Columns element previously did. \n\nUpdate #2: Column widths snap to a grid\nAs before, you can adjust the width of a column simply by dragging the blue line that divides two columns. To help keep column widths consistent between pages we've introduced a grid system to which all columns snap. If you want to break free of this grid, just hold \"Shift\" while you drag the column divider line and you can drag it wherever you like. \n\nUpdate #3: New Behavior for Moving and Copying Columns\nIt may appear that the options to \"Move\" and \"Copy\" a set of columns has been removed. But this isn't the case at all. You simply have to click on one of the divider lines in that set of columns and the move / copy controls will appear in the upper left of the columns as always.\n\nUpdate #4: New Text+Image Behavior\nWe've removed the Text+Image element because you can now drag an image right on to (or out of) a block of text. This makes it much simpler to add an image to a page and allow text to wrap around it. \n\nUpdate #5: New Spacer Element\nWe've added a new Spacer Element so you add extra space to a page as needed. This element can be made as wide or as tall as needed to ensure it best fits your design. \n\nIf what I\u2019ve described here does not fit with what you\u2019re seeing, can you give me a little more detail so I can look into this issue and get it fixed for you? I promise we\u2019ll make sure things work better for you than ever before. "

                        "Pasting text from other sources can bring fonts and hidden code from those sources along with it. This external formatting can cause conflicts and errors on any website. In the best case scenario, the pasted text becomes unpredictable and difficult to control. In many cases, the external formatting code \"breaks\" other code on the site and causes the page not to load for some users.  It may work for you for a month and then break your formatting without warning. \n\nTo fix any of these formatting issues just select / highlight any text that has a different font and click the Tx button in the text toolbar. This will strip the extra formatting and cause the text to snap to whatever font you have selected for your site under Design > Design Options.\n\nThe best approach to avoid these issues altogether is to copy and paste your text from Word into a plain text document, and then adjust the formatting within Weebly.  You can create plain text documents via the NotePad program on PC or the TextEdit program on Mac. \n\nThough Word (and similar programs) use formatting that can destroy the font formatting of a webpage, pasting from Plain Text works perfectly.\n\nIf you have any further questions about this, please just let me know and I'll get right back to you."

It is possible to set up a podcast in Weebly but there are several steps involved and we're somewhat limited in the support we can provide for this process. Here are the instructions if you want to give it a try:\n\n**UPLOAD THE AUDIO FILE**\n\nYou'll need to use a File element (not the audio element) to upload your mp3 file.\n\n**CREATE THE XML**\n\nYou can use the free tool at http://webnet77.com/podcast-rss/index.pl/PODS to create an XML file with the basic information about your podcast. \n\nThis produces XML markup with one tag. \n\nPaste this content into an XML file on your computer using a text editor like notepad or textedit and save it as podcast.xml.\n\nNote: You will need the URL of your mp3. You can get this by opening the page with the audio file in your *live site*, and right or control-clicking to copy the link.\n\nYou may need to add the file size of your mp3 in bytes if the \"auto\" setting in the XML generator doesn't work with your file.\n\n**UPLOAD THE XML**\n\nAdd a File element to a page in your Weebly site and upload the XML file you made in the last step. \n\nPublish your site, then right- or Control-click the link and copy the URL of the file. This is the \"Podcast URL\" that you'll provide to iTunes.\n\n**UPDATE THE XML**\n\nFor each episode you produce, you'll have to upload the audio file, and re-upload the XML. iTunes should update automatically."

You can drag a page to the right so that it is underneath and slightly to the right (indented) of the page that you want to be the primary page. It should snap into place, slightly indented. Then next time you publish, it will show up underneath that page in your navigation.\n\nFor more help creating subpages, please see [this link](http://kb.weebly.com/subpages.html).\n\nPlease keep in mind that it isn't possible to make a top-level navigation page link unclickable so that only the sub-pages can be clicked.  The best work-around for this is to add links directly to the main page that lead to each of the sub-pages.  That way people who click the main page link don't see a blank page.    \n\nFor assistance creating links, check out [How to Create Links](http://kb.weebly.com/links.html)"

Unfortunately, the embedded document element is one of the very few elements that we did not create ourselves so there is nothing we can alter on our end to resolve the problem unfortunately.\n\nIf you are trying to upload a PDF file, I'd recommend simply linking to it in the interim. Linked PDFs open in a new tab in the browser as illustrated in the first part of this article:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/documents.html\n\nLinking to PDFs is actually significantly better than embedding them as browsers know what to do with a linked PDF and will display them perfectly.\n\nThere is no other way around the problem right now. You may want to use a third-party document viewer to embed your documents (like CrocoDoc.com). You'd upload the document to their service and then add it to your site via our custom html element. For assistance with the custom html element, please see:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/custom-html.html\n\nScribd is one of the few elements in our system that is not built or controlled directly by us. So we're at the mercy of Scribd in this case. If we could fix it ourselves it'd already be fixed. I'm truly sorry for this and wish it was fixed already."

The ones that are will always show up in the count, but at the moment, if someone visits your blog and then copies the URL to your post and goes to Twitter and pastes that link, it would not show up in the count.\n\nThis is because the tweet buttons are currently set up to work with the old blog URLs in order to keep the tweet counts intact on older posts. Our developers are currently working on a solution for the tweet buttons, but for the time being you may see a discrepancy between what's displayed on your post button versus the actual number of tweets at Twitter.\n\nPlease note that people can still tweet your posts no matter what - it's just the displayed count on the button on each post that is not showing the full total. It won't affect peoples' ability to tweet your posts at all."

It should be available and working again shortly.  \n\n2 -- Start a new forum via a tool like nabble.com.  It's easy to add a Nabble forum to your site and Nabble has been around for a long time.  Pretty confident they're not going anywhere. \n\nWhen you build a forum with a tool like Nabble.com they give you embed code to use to add the forum to your site.

If you viewed the document at home, you'd be able to see it with no problems at all. \n\nCan you ask your IT department if they can unblock Scribd? This is the only way for those documents to be viewed at your school. \n\nOtherwise I'd recommend linking to PDF versions of your files. Browsers know how to properly display PDFs and will do so in a new tab when the link is clicked. It's a very good way to share PDF documents (though it doesn't work nearly so well for documents other than PDFs). You can learn about how to link to PDFs and other files here:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/links.html"

When you invite a student as an editor, strange things can happen as the system tries to process that request and make it work. Ultimately, you will wind up with errors because it's just not allowed.\n\nWe have had a few requests from teachers to allow students to edit the class website and that's something that we hope to have in place before the next school year starts, but for now, the only option is to have each student work on their own website in their own account and then link to each of those from the class site.

However, we want this to be as easy of a transition as possible so there are a few resources to help you get started. Our Beginner's Guide to Weebly is a great starting point. You can find it here:\n\nhttp://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/sections/200354313-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Weebly\n\nWe also host several free live training sessions every week to walk customers through the ins-and-outs of building a Weebly website.

We've written a short guide to to doing this and you can read it here: \n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/multiple-languages.html\n\nIf you do create a different site for the additional language and have a paid service like Pro on your main site, you would need to upgrade each site individually.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to translate your content into multiple languages you may want to consider one of the widgets available from [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com/translate_tools?hl=en&layout=1&eotf=1) or [Babelfish](http://www.babelfish.com/bing/). These widgets automatically translate your site into whatever language the visitor chooses.  \n\nYou can copy the widget code into an Embed Code element to add it to your site.

You can print a webpage, but it is likely not going to look the way you expect it to, and this would be true of most any website.  If you are interested in learning more about this issue and what you can do that might help, check out the following page for more information:\n\nhttp://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Printing-webpages-frequently-asked-questions\n\n\nIf you're concerned about your header image not printing, check your browser's Print options. It's in different places on different browsers but there should be a box you can check to \"print background colors and images\". That is typically turned off by default in order to conserve ink but when you turn it on, your header image and other layout images will print. \n\nYou may have better results simply taking a screenshot of the content you wish to print, then printing from the image directly.\n\nIf you aren't sure how to take a screenshot on your computer, please refer to the following page for simple instructions:\n\nhttp://take-a-screenshot.org/"

Malware on your computer or in your browser. If you check your site from another computer, you won't see any ads because they're not actually part of your webpage. You should run a full virus scan on your computer and if the problem persists, try something like Adaware (http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php) which searches for and disables adware in particular. Or try this very easy guide to removing it:\n\nhttp://botcrawl.com/how-to-remove-text-enhance/\n\nOR\n\n2). Third party code on your site that is overtaking your content to serve ads.  This is most commonly caused by a click counter.  If you have a click counter at the bottom of your site somewhere, I'd recommend removing it. \n\nI cannot stress enough that Weebly does not and will not run ads on your website.  We are a profitable company and the reason we're profitable is because many of our users upgrade to our Pro / Domain services.  If we treated our free users (or paid users) poorly and placed ads on their sites without their permission then no one would want to upgrade or renew."

Malware on your computer or in your browser. If you check your site from another computer, you won't see any ads because they're not actually part of your webpage. You should run a full virus scan on your computer and if the problem persists, try something like Adaware (http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_free.php) which searches for and disables adware in particular. Or try this very easy guide to removing it:\n\nhttp://botcrawl.com/how-to-remove-text-enhance/\n\nOR\n\n2). Third party code on your site that is overtaking your content to serve ads.  This is most commonly caused by a click counter.  If you have a click counter at the bottom of your site somewhere, I'd recommend removing it. \n\nI cannot stress enough that Weebly does not and will not run ads on your website.  We are a profitable company and the reason we're profitable is because many of our users upgrade to our Pro / Domain services.  If we treated our free users (or paid users) poorly and placed ads on their sites without their permission then no one would want to upgrade or renew."

There's an excellent chance one of those will be a good fit for your own site.\n\nIf you still want a custom design, there are a number of third-party companies out there that sell and design themes for Weebly users.

This allows students to build up to five sites each with unlimited pages and provides access to a number of other features that are detailed here:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/faq-proed.html\n\nThe Pro version is $39.95 per teacher account, per year. \n\nBoth free and Pro Weebly for Education accounts allow you to administer up to 40 student accounts, but if you need more students, you can purchase extra accounts for $10 per 10 extra students.  See how that works here:\n\nhttp://kb.weebly.com/manage-students.html\n\nFor schools that want Pro service for fifteen teachers or more, the Campus edition is an even better fit as it provides Pro service at a discount and allows a school administrator to manage teachers from a central campus account.  Learn more at http://campusedition.weebly.com.  You can sign up for a trial of the Campus Edition from this page if so desired."

Hosting packages range from $5/month up to several hundred dollars per month with extra fees for bandwidth usage, file storage over a certain amount, e-mail services, a website builder, etc.\n\nWeebly operates on a different business model. We provide free hosting for all our users (along with unlimited bandwidth and file storage, a free website builder, etc.), therefore we must charge full price for domain registration.\n\nWhile you can register your domain name with GoDaddy for about $10 per year, by the time you add in all the services that Weebly provides for free, the price is significantly higher.\n\nIf you have a Weebly Starter or Pro subscription, you can register your domain with a discount registrar and host the site with Weebly. In the long run, this can cause a lot of headaches since you'll be responsible for updating your own DNS settings to point to Weebly and you'll need to manage accounts with two different companies. There is a lot to be said for the simplicity of having your registration and hosting with one company and having all the setup and configuration done for you.\n\nUltimately, we'll be happy to help you with whatever option you choose. If you are looking at discount registrars, please look for one that gives you full control over your DNS settings (in particular you'll need the ability to create A-records and if you plan to have e-mail you'll need access to MX records). Many discount registrars only allow you to change nameservers unless you purchase a hosting package in addition to your domain registration. Some other \"catches\" you should look out for include a deep discount on your first year of registration and a higher price for renewal, a discounted price for registration only if you purchase hosting from the company, and you need to make sure that the domain will be registered in your name and can be transferred to another registrar at a later date."

We don't do anything of the sort.  Our pricing is based entirely on a monthly rate per site, so you're only paying for the sites you create.   So you only pay us if you're successfully making money from the platform. \n\nIf you have no need for a White Label system, then you are welcome to design websites for your clients using regular Weebly (weebly.com) with Weebly Pro.  This is less expensive, but if you invite your clients to help edit their own sites they'll be able to see that you're using our service."

This isn't a problem only with Weebly; it can occur when posting a link from any website, and there is not a whole lot that you or I can do about it right now.\nSometimes if you go to post the link and don't see all of the images in your post, you can cancel and then try adding the link again.
