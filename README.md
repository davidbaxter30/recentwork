Here you can see a couple of projects I've been working on in my free time. They are a little rough but they are working which is nice. 

| Project | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Live Suggestions | To accept sugestions from my coworkers to improve our tools at Weebly. |
| JediArchives | To create a better collection of documents that the employees at weebly can use to help the customers. Automating the process of gathering and displaying the information |


## Live Suggestions

Purpose: To accept sugestions from my coworkers to improve our tools at Weebly. 

Features: 

- [x] Suggestion Box. Accepts suggestions
- [x] Viewing Pane. Allows users to vote on other suggestions and their own. 
- [x] Management Pane. Allows admins to reject or accept the suggestions. Notifies suggester via email if declined. 


## JediArchives

Purpose: To create a better collection of documents that the employees at weebly can use to help the customers. Automating the process of gathering and displaying the information.  

Features: 

- [x] Search: Uses Angular NgRepeat and filters to search the data. 
- [x] Get: Retrieves the information from the appropriate API 
- [x] Retains state! You can share links from any article, bug, or macro and they will find the correct object using the power of UI-router

When finished I hope it will more closely follow the style guide that I like to use.

## Interests and future projects 


I am a huge fan of SASS and Jade as far as preprocessors go for HTML/CSS. SASS really helps with organizing the css and keeping it clean and minimal. I am just as comfortable writing with plain ol HTML/CSS as well though.
