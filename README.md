# recentwork

Here you can see a couple of projects I've been working on in my free time. They are a little rough but they are working which is nice. I was taking a very brute force approach to writing these as I wanted to get them out pretty fast for work.

////////////////
Live Suggestions
///////////////

Purpose: To accept sugestions from my coworkers to improve our tools at Weebly. 

Features: 

1. Suggestion Box. Accepts suggestions
2. Viewing Pane. Allows users to vote on other suggestions and their own. 
3. Management Pane. Allows admins to reject or accept the suggestions. Notifies suggester via email if declined. 

////////////////
Search Pages
///////////////

Purpose: To create a better collection of documents that the employees at weebly can use to help the customers. Automating the process of gathering and displaying the information.  

Features: 

1. Search: Uses Angular NgRepeat and filters to search the data. 
2. Get: Retrieves the information from the apropriete API 
3. Category Generator: Find the tags or categetories and generates an array to be used with an NgRepeat as the category list. 

Very much not complete or optimized. 

When finished I hope it will more closely follow the style guide that I like to use.

I am a huge fan of SASS and Jade as far as preprocessors go for HTML/CSS. SASS really helps with organizing the css and keeping it clean and minimal. I am just as comfortable writing with plain ol HTML/CSS as well though.
